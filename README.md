## Description/Purpose

ShowOff required, as part of their Technical Test, a small rails application that allows users to view a collection of widgets.  An unregistered or logged out user can see a page listing all of the widgets in the collection, inlcuding a link to the user who created it and he/she can search the public/visible widgets.  If an unregistered/logged out user clicks on the widget creator's name, they will be taken to a page that show's that user's detail, along with a listing of all the widgets that user created.

An unregistered user may also register with the web app in order to login to an account.

A logged in user can view their own dashboard.  A user's dashboard will have a listing of their widgets.  A logged in user can create new widgets, delete existing widgets, see more details about a specific widget, edit a widget and search his own widgets.
